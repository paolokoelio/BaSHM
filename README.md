This is a project for a Master Thesis in Computer Engineering about TRIAGE methods application
in Digital Forensics.

Based on pytsk, BaSHM stands for [...].


The aim is to develop a Python program to speed up and automate parts of procedures
for forensic data acquisition and searching for clues (artifacts to-be evidence).




We skip the original pytsk README to this link: https://github.com/py4n6/pytsk

If downloaded pytsk using git you'll have to first run:

python setup.py update

To build the bindings just use the standard Python distutils method:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install

At the top level of the source tree.

The Python binding is autogenerated from the libtsk header files
using a small OO C shim. This means that most of the fields in many of
the structs are already available. We aim to provide most of the
functionality using this shim (e.g. traversing and iterating over
lists etc). The authoritative source of documentation is the library
API linked above.
